# TANK BUSTER

## Proposal

### Concept

Playing as a powerful tank unit, find your way through a malleable maze to destroy your opponent! Use upgrades placed around the map to equip yourself with new weapons and abilities to outsmart your enemy and blow up their tank before they get you. With randomly generated maps and a wide selection of weapons, there are countless ways to play!

### Genre

2-player tank shooter

### Platform

Currently desktop only

### Story

Two players take the role of tank drones ordered to destroy each other. The point of the game is to outmaneuver your opponent by traversing or destroying the randomly generated maze and to destroy the other player’s tank.

### Esthetics

Tank Buster is a cartoon-style game, with very simplistic graphics. I will probably draw the models myself, potentially finding the tank models on an open-source website

For sound, there will likely be a simple theme in the background, and sounds for the movement of the tank and the various weapons. This is not guaranteed, and not necessary for the idea of the game, but will be added if I have spare time in the creation of the game. These sounds will be simple sounds probable found off an open source site

### Gameplay

#### Mechanics

The player will be able to control the movement of the tank and fire their weapon. There will be walls that the tank cannot drive through, but can be destroyed with 2 shots from the tank. Also around the map will be upgrade boxes that will reward a random weapon or tank upgrade.

#### Controls

Player 1: Movement: WASD Keys Fire: Left-Alt Player 2: Movement: Arrow Keys Fire: Space

The player will learn these controls through a scene in the game demonstrating the controls listed above, and will figure out through playing the game the other mechanics.

### To Win

As for how to win, there are no limits. The tanks can be killed with any weapon, even the base tank cannon. It’s up to the player to decide how to go about playing the game.
